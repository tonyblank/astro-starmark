   npm install starmark-integration
   ```

   ```js
   // astro.config.mjs
   import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";
   import starmark from "starmark-integration";

   export default defineConfig({
     integrations: [
       starmark({
         ui: {
           categories: ["Bug", "Feature Request", "Question"],
         },
       }),
     ],
   });
   ```

## Why StarMark?

Documentation sites are crucial for user experience, but collecting actionable feedback can be challenging. StarMark bridges this gap by providing:

- **Low friction feedback collection** - Users can report issues without leaving your docs
- **Contextual information** - Automatically captures page URL, user agent, and selected text
- **Flexible routing** - Send feedback to the tools your team already uses
- **Privacy focused** - No tracking, minimal data collection, users remain in control
